What is data?
=============

Since we've spent some time discussing what data science is, we should spend some time looking at what exactly data *is*.

### Definitions of "data"

First, let's look at what a few trusted sources consider data to be.

First up, we'll look at the [Cambridge English Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/data), which states that data is:

> Information, especially facts or numbers, collected to be examined and considered and used to help decision-making.

Second, we'll look at the definition provided by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data), which is:

> A set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables.

These are slightly different definitions and they get at different components of what data is. Both agree that data is values or numbers or facts, but the Cambridge definition focuses on the actions that surround data - data is collected, examined and most importantly, used to inform decisions. We've focused on this aspect before - we've talked about how the most important part of data science is the question and how all we are doing is using data to answer the question. The Cambridge definition focuses on this.

The Wikipedia definition focuses more on what data entails. And although it is a fairly short definition, we'll take a second to parse this and focus on each component individually.

So, the first thing to focus on is **"a set of values"** - to have data, you need a set of items to measure from. In statistics, this set of items is often called the population. The set as a whole is what you are trying to discover something about. For example, that set of items required to answer your question might be all websites or it might be the set of all people coming to websites, or it might be a set of all people getting a particular drug. But in general, it's a set of things that you're going to make measurements on.

The next thing to focus on is **"variables"** - variables are measurements or characteristics of an item. For example, you could be measuring the height of a person, or you are measuring the amount of time a person stays on a website. On the other hand, it might be a more qualitative characteristic you are trying to measure, like what a person clicks on on a website, or whether you think the person visiting is male or female.

Finally, we have both **qualitative and quantitative** variables. Qualitative variables are, unsurprisingly, information about qualities. They are things like country of origin, sex, or treatment group. They're usually described by words, not numbers, and they are not necessarily ordered. Quantitative variables on the other hand, are information about quantities. Quantitative measurements are usually described by numbers and are measured on a continuous, ordered scale; they're things like height, weight and blood pressure.
